# Nanomaterials-Nanostructures-Project
In this project, we analyzed the main applications of Molybdenium Trioxide (MoO3). Molybdenium is a transitional metal w/ a variable range of applications. The main polymers created and their crystalline structure are analyzed as the indirect band-gap of the material, as it compromises the application of the material in some specific areas.
